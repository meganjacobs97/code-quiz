# Quiz About Me

## A timed quiz with multiple-choice questions, including a user interface that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript 

This was mainly an exercise in web APIs and dynamically adding HTML and CSS elements to a webpage using JavaScript. 

The app features sections that appear and disappear on the page as you advance through the quiz. There is also a timer that features time deductions when questions are answered incorrectly. When the quiz is over, scores can be saved using local storage.
